import PackageDescription

/// Because some code is shared between `ComposableEnvironment` and `GlobalEnvironment`, and in
/// order to expose only the minimum API surface, the package is split in several targets.
///
/// The third product called `ComposableDependencies` can be used in case you want to define
/// dependencies in an environment-agnostic way. Such dependencies can then be imported and used by
/// `ComposableEnvironment` or `GlobalEnvironment`.
///
/// Targets with names starting with a underscore are used for implementation only and their types
/// exported on a case by case basis. They should not be imported as a whole without prefixing the
/// import with the `@_implementationOnly` keyword.
